    <p><h1>Los J칩venes Flamencos</h1></p><br>
    <p>
        <span rel="#image1"></span>This time I have the honor of inviting one of the collectors of Flamenco that I admire the most: Pablo Pueblo.

        Together with him, we will return to the modern sounds of Andalusia focusing on a movement that emerged after the end of the Spanish fascist dictatorship: "Los J칩venes Flamencos" (the young flamencos).

        Social changes and opening to the rest of Europe after 40 years of oppression made the younger generation of musicians despise traditional music, at that time seen as the music of a poor and backward country. <span rel="#image2"></span>

        While most of the youth became obsessed with reproducing English synthpop in the so-called "Movida Madrile침a", a group of musicians and producers focused on redefining the great musical value of flamenco by mixing it with jazz, blues, salsa or pop, <span rel="#image3"></span>  creating one of the most important modernization movements of the genre.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Since the end of the 80s and during the following decade, the work of the legendary independent record label Nuevos Medios of producer Mario Pacheco created a series of albums that today we consider unforgettable but that at the time obtained more recognition outside the country than within it, pushing the flamenco to new horizons.

    </p><br>
    <p>
        We will review key figures of the J칩venes Flamencos such as Ray Heredia, Rafael Riqueni, Pata Negra or La Chica in an hour of the finest pieces of the movement on vinyl.<span rel="#image4"></span>
