### *What music emerged from the fall of Al-Andalous?* 


<br>

Al-Andalus is known for its golden age of culture and music, particularly after the arrival of Ziryab from Baghdad to Córdoba, which led to the development of classical Andalusian music. 

<br>

Beyond the courtly music, a rich and diverse musical landscape emerged. This included popular Andalusian music, the Jewish Spanish cancionero, and the sounds of India and Pakistan brought by the newly arrived Roma population.

<br>

Following the fall of Al-Andalus in 1492, the Roma, Jewish, and Muslim inhabitants faced persecution and expulsion. Many sought refuge in North Africa or the Ottoman Empire, spreading their culture and music throughout the diaspora. Others remained in Andalusia, preserving their traditions in secret and creating new songs of resistance and suffering, which laid the foundation for *Flamenco*.

<br>

This session is the first part of a broader research in progress made in collaboration with **Disco Atlas**, Moroccan music expert and collector.

The first part of the session will explore the Andalusian diaspora and its connection to the most fundamental and primitive forms of Flamenco. In the end, we will examine how artists from different regions have researched the roots of Flamenco in a more artistic approach.
